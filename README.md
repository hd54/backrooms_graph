# Backrooms Graph

The Backrooms are a fictional, alternate dimension outside the scope of the reality.
Thus, a person ending up at the Backrooms is the result of "no-clipping", glitching through solid environments.

This project aims to provide users an interactive guide in navigating through different levels of the backrooms.
The project stores a SQLite3 database of all existing levels' information and display the levels as nodes of the
graph. Users may click on the node for more information.

The project has been divided into several phases:

## Phase 1:

## Phase 2:
